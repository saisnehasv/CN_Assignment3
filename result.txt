Question: B sends ping request (default of 1 request per second) for 1 minute, takes a break for 30 seconds and again 
sends ping request for 1 minute (default of 1 request per second) to A. B implements rate limit using action "-j ACCEPT" 
for A only and drops echo request as per X andY. No echo reply should be dropped. From B send ping packet to some 
other machine (e.g.google) for 1 minute, no packets should be dropped. Implement the rate limit and explain the 
behaviour.

Solution :

> The two machines chosen by our team was :
      --Machine A: Windows OS (host)
      --Machine B:Linux OS (VM) 

> Computation of X and Y
    --Smallest usn in the team : 1KS17CS064
    --Last digit : D = 4
    --Average packets per minute : X = D+10 = 14
    --Burst rate : Y = X/2 = 14/2 = 7

>This assignment deals with the implementation of end to end QoS support.QoS is used to manage data 
traffic to reduce packet loss, latency and jitter on the network.

Justification of Implementation: 
   We used the command:: "sudo iptables -A INPUT -m limit --limit 14/minute --limit-burst 7" to try and send 14 
   packets in average with a burst rate of 7 packets.This command ran succesfully leading to the implication that 
   the rule was set. However we faced a few challenges in trying to send ping messages from the linux OS to windows 
   OS and we werent able to to verify whether the rule was working.
  We also used the command: "ping -w google" to send a ping to google for one minute ,with the default rate of one 
  packet per second and we were succesfully able to do so.


Challenges Faced:
1.We used various commands (included in the challenges faced snapshot) to try and send a ping message to the windows server ,
but we were unable to resolve it.
 2.As we couldnt successfully send a ping message from one machine to another , we couldnt get a tcpdump from wireshark 
 to  verify the rules.
3.Due to the limited time constraint, and various internals and externals around the corner we were not 
able to conduct a thorough reasearch about the assignment statement and the challenges we faced as much 
as we would have liked to.
